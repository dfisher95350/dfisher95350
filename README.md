## Welcome!

I'm a **professional software developer** of many years experience. You can review my technical experience (and my
r√©sum√©) here: **https://dfisher95350.github.io/**.

My **private repositories** reflect my technical interests, among which the `java` and `javascript` ecosystems are
chief. These repos are polyglot (i.e. they include, for example, Kotlin and TypeScript, respectively). Other repos
include `blockchain`, `cpp`, `data` (science, stores, and structures), `docker`, `dotnet`, `go`, `kubernetes`, `python`
, `ruby`, `rust`, `unity`, `vagrant`. Each repository contains language and library exercises, framework experiments,
dev configurations, etc. I also keep a `notebook` of over-arching topics, including design patterns.

For deep cut nerd cred, my MO2 and ENB configurations for Skyrim and Fallout are also committed here. :video_game:

I also enjoy drawing and painting. My profile picture is a freehand self-portrait made with Procreate on iPad Pro.
