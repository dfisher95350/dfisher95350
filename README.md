## Welcome!

I'm a **professional software developer** of many years experience. You can review my technical experience (and my
r√©sum√©) here: **https://dfisher95350.github.io/**.

Almost all of my repositories are private.
They reflect my technical interests,
among which the JVM and JavaScript ecosystems are chief.
Each repository contains language and library exercises, framework experiments, dev configurations, etc.
I also keep a `notebook` of overarching topics.
You can find public info regarding many of my private repos [here](https://dfisher95350.github.io/repositories).

For deep cut nerd cred, my MO2 and ENB configurations for Skyrim and Fallout are also committed here. :video_game:

I also enjoy drawing and painting. My profile picture is a freehand self-portrait made with Procreate on iPad Pro.
