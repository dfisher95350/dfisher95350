## Welcome!

I'm a professional software developer of many years experience. My personal repositories are private, but I've provided an overview (and my r√©sum√©) on my Github Pages site: https://dfisher95350.github.io/. Note that I am late to GitHub, as a long-time user of the Atlassian suite (and their Bitbucket was first to have free private repositories).

I also enjoy drawing and painting. My profile picture is a freehand self-portrait made with Procreate on iPad Pro.
