## Welcome!

I'm a professional software developer of many years experience. You can review my technical experience (and my r√©sum√©) here: https://dfisher95350.github.io/.

My (private) repositories reflect my technical interests, among which the `java` (including `Kotlin`) and `javascript` (including `TypeScript`) ecosystems are chief. Others include `cpp`, `data`, `docker`, `dotnet`, `go`, `kubernetes`, `maven`, `python`, `ruby`, `rust`, `unity`, `vagrant`. Each repository contains language and library exercises, framework experiments, dev configurations, etc. I also keep a `notebook` of over-arching topics, including design patterns. 

As a long-time user of the Atlassian suite, I am late to GitHub. (Bitbucket was first to have no-cost private repositories.)

For deep cut nerd cred, my MO2 and ENB configurations for Skyrim and Fallout are also committed here. :video_game:

I also enjoy drawing and painting. My profile picture is a freehand self-portrait made with Procreate on iPad Pro.
